# Manjoot - Zuma Frontend Challenge submission

I hope you are well! In this repo you will find my submission for the Zuma front end challenge.

## What I was aked to build?

**A React component(s) that fulfills the following brief:**

Given a value that is changing over time, highlight the value each time it changes, with different highlights if the value increments or decrements.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Your component must display the value
2. Your component must have resting state with no highlighting
3. Your component must highlight increments in the value
4. Your component must highlight decrements in the value

## How to setup

Run the following commands to setup, given `node` and `npm` is available:

1. git clone https://github.com/manjoot/frontend-challenge.git
2. cd frontend-challenge
3. npm install
4. npm start

## Additionally installed tools/dependencies

None other than the current ones!

## If this was a bigger project

As this is a coding the challenge, the scope is relatively small. However, if this was a bigger challenge - I would:

1. Add further unit tests to ensure I'm covering more areas of the application as well as dynamic tests, as the current tests are not dynamic - so if content changes, then the tests will break. I intended to use jest and enzyme, but encountered problems with the setup and installing, which consumed time and I ended up abandoning.
2. As aesthetically pleasing as the current app looks, it would be nice to have more time to add further flair e.g. animations using a library like framer motion, a component library like chakra ui etc.
3. As structured as the current application is, further time to refactor code would be nice.
